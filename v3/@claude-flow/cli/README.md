### Key Capabilities

🤖 **60+ Specialized Agents** - Ready-to-use AI agents for coding, code review, testing, security audits, documentation, and DevOps. Each agent is optimized for its specific role.

🐝 **Coordinated Agent Teams** - Run unlimited agents simultaneously in organized swarms. Agents spawn sub-workers, communicate, share context, and divide work automatically using hierarchical (queen/workers) or mesh (peer-to-peer) patterns.

🧠 **Learns From Your Workflow** - The system remembers what works. Successful patterns are stored and reused, routing similar tasks to the best-performing agents. Gets smarter over time.

🔌 **Works With Any LLM** - Switch between Claude, GPT, Gemini, Cohere, or local models like Llama. Automatic failover if one provider is unavailable. Smart routing picks the cheapest option that meets quality requirements.

⚡ **Plugs Into Claude Code** - Native integration via MCP (Model Context Protocol). Use ruflo commands directly in your Claude Code sessions with full tool access.

🔒 **Production-Ready Security** - Built-in protection against prompt injection, input validation, path traversal prevention, command injection blocking, and safe credential handling.

🧩 **Extensible Plugin System** - Add custom capabilities with the plugin SDK. Create workers, hooks, providers, and security modules. Share plugins via the decentralized IPFS marketplace.

| Learning | SONA, MoE, ReasoningBank | Self-improves from results (<0.05ms adaptation) |
| Fine-tuning | MicroLoRA, EWC++ | Lightweight adaptation without full retraining |

</details>

<details>
<summary>⚡ <strong>Optimization</strong> — How to reduce cost and latency</summary>

Skip expensive LLM calls for simple tasks using WebAssembly transforms, and compress tokens to reduce API costs by 30-50%.

| Layer | Components | What It Does |
|-------|------------|--------------|
| Agent Booster | WASM, AST analysis | Skips LLM for simple edits (<1ms) |
| Token Optimizer | Compression, Caching | Reduces token usage 30-50% |

</details>

<details>

| Security | AIDefence, Validation | Blocks injection, detects threats |
| Sessions | Persist, Restore, Export | Saves context across conversations |
| GitHub | PR, Issues, Workflows | Manages repos and code reviews |
| Analytics | Metrics, Benchmarks | Monitors performance, finds bottlenecks |

</details>

<details>
<summary>🎯 <strong>Task Routing</strong> — Extend your Claude Code subscription by 250%</summary>

Smart routing skips expensive LLM calls when possible. Simple edits use WASM (free), medium tasks use cheaper models. This can extend your Claude Code usage by 250% or save significantly on direct API costs.

| Complexity | Handler | Speed |
|------------|---------|-------|
| Simple | Agent Booster (WASM) | <1ms |
| Medium | Haiku/Sonnet | ~500ms |
| Complex | Opus + Swarm | 2-5s |

</details>

<details>
<summary>⚡ <strong>Agent Booster (WASM)</strong> — 352x faster code transforms, skip LLM entirely</summary>

Agent Booster uses WebAssembly to handle simple code transformations without calling the LLM at all. When the hooks system detects a simple task, it routes directly to Agent Booster for instant results.

**Supported Transform Intents:**

| Intent | What It Does | Example |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| `var-to-const` | Convert var/let to const | `var x = 1` → `const x = 1` |
| `add-types` | Add TypeScript type annotations | `function foo(x)` → `function foo(x: string)` |
| `add-error-handling` | Wrap in try/catch | Adds proper error handling |
| `async-await` | Convert promises to async/await | `.then()` chains → `await` |
| `add-logging` | Add console.log statements | Adds debug logging |
| `remove-console` | Strip console.* calls | Removes all console statements |

**Hook Signals:**

When you see these in hook output, the system is telling you how to optimize:

```bash
# Agent Booster available - skip LLM entirely
[AGENT_BOOSTER_AVAILABLE] Intent: var-to-const
→ Use Edit tool directly, 352x faster than LLM

# Model recommendation for Task tool
[TASK_MODEL_RECOMMENDATION] Use model="haiku"
→ Pass model="haiku" to Task tool for cost savings
```

**Performance:**

| Metric | Agent Booster | LLM Call |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| Latency | <1ms | 2-5s |
| Cost | $0 | $0.0002-$0.015 |
| Speedup | **352x faster** | baseline |

</details>

<details>
<summary>💰 <strong>Token Optimizer</strong> — 30-50% token reduction</summary>

The Token Optimizer integrates agentic-flow optimizations to reduce API costs by compressing context and caching results.

**Savings Breakdown:**

| Optimization | Token Savings | How It Works |
|--------------|---------------|--------------|
| ReasoningBank retrieval | -32% | Fetches relevant patterns instead of full context |
| Agent Booster edits | -15% | Simple edits skip LLM entirely |
| Cache (95% hit rate) | -10% | Reuses embeddings and patterns |
| Optimal batch size | -20% | Groups related operations |
| **Combined** | **30-50%** | Stacks multiplicatively |

**Usage:**

```typescript
import { getTokenOptimizer } from '@claude-flow/integration';
const optimizer = await getTokenOptimizer();

// Get compact context (32% fewer tokens)
const ctx = await optimizer.getCompactContext("auth patterns");

// Optimized edit (352x faster for simple transforms)
await optimizer.optimizedEdit(file, oldStr, newStr, "typescript");

// Optimal config for swarm (100% success rate)
const config = optimizer.getOptimalConfig(agentCount);
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>🛡️ <strong>Anti-Drift Swarm Configuration</strong> — Prevent goal drift in multi-agent work</summary>

Complex swarms can drift from their original goals. Ruflo V3 includes anti-drift defaults that prevent agents from going off-task.

**Recommended Configuration:**

```javascript
// Anti-drift defaults (ALWAYS use for coding tasks)
swarm_init({
  topology: "hierarchical",  // Single coordinator enforces alignment
  maxAgents: 8,              // Smaller team = less drift surface
  strategy: "specialized"    // Clear roles reduce ambiguity
})
```

**Why This Prevents Drift:**

| Setting | Anti-Drift Benefit |
|---------|-------------------|
| `hierarchical` | Coordinator validates each output against goal, catches divergence early |
| `maxAgents: 6-8` | Fewer agents = less coordination overhead, easier alignment |
| `specialized` | Clear boundaries - each agent knows exactly what to do, no overlap |
| `raft` consensus | Leader maintains authoritative state, no conflicting decisions |

**Additional Anti-Drift Measures:**

- Frequent checkpoints via `post-task` hooks
- Shared memory namespace for all agents
- Short task cycles with verification gates
- Hierarchical coordinator reviews all outputs

**Task → Agent Routing (Anti-Drift):**

| Code | Task Type | Recommended Agents |
|------|-----------|-------------------|
| 1 | Bug Fix | coordinator, researcher, coder, tester |
| 3 | Feature | coordinator, architect, coder, tester, reviewer |
| 5 | Refactor | coordinator, architect, coder, reviewer |
| 7 | Performance | coordinator, perf-engineer, coder |
| 9 | Security | coordinator, security-architect, auditor |
| 11 | Memory | coordinator, memory-specialist, perf-engineer |

</details>

### Claude Code: With vs Without Ruflo

| Capability | Claude Code Alone | Claude Code + Ruflo |
|------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| **Agent Collaboration** | Agents work in isolation, no shared context | Agents collaborate via swarms with shared memory and consensus |
| **Coordination** | Manual orchestration between tasks | Queen-led hierarchy with 5 consensus algorithms (Raft, Byzantine, Gossip) |
| **Hive Mind** | ⛔ Not available | 🐝 Queen-led swarms with collective intelligence, 3 queen types, 8 worker types |
| **Consensus** | ⛔ No multi-agent decisions | Byzantine fault-tolerant voting (f < n/3), weighted, majority |
| **Memory** | Session-only, no persistence | HNSW vector memory with 150x-12,500x faster retrieval + knowledge graph |
| **Vector Database** | ⛔ No native support | 🐘 RuVector PostgreSQL with 77+ SQL functions, ~61µs search, 16,400 QPS |
| **Knowledge Graph** | ⛔ Flat insight lists | PageRank + community detection identifies influential insights (ADR-049) |
| **Collective Memory** | ⛔ No shared knowledge | Shared knowledge base with LRU cache, SQLite persistence, 8 memory types |
| **Learning** | Static behavior, no adaptation | SONA self-learning with <0.05ms adaptation, LearningBridge for insights |
| **Agent Scoping** | Single project scope | 3-scope agent memory (project/local/user) with cross-agent transfer |
| **Task Routing** | You decide which agent to use | Intelligent routing based on learned patterns (89% accuracy) |
| **Complex Tasks** | Manual breakdown required | Automatic decomposition across 5 domains (Security, Core, Integration, Support) |
| **Background Workers** | Nothing runs automatically | 12 context-triggered workers auto-dispatch on file changes, patterns, sessions |
| **LLM Provider** | Anthropic only | 6 providers with automatic failover and cost-based routing (85% savings) |
| **Security** | Standard protections | CVE-hardened with bcrypt, input validation, path traversal prevention |
| **Performance** | Baseline | 2.8-4.4x faster tasks, 10-20x faster swarm spawning, 84.8% SWE-Bench |

<details>
<summary>🤖 <strong>OpenAI Codex CLI Support</strong> — Full Codex integration with self-learning</summary>

Ruflo supports both **Claude Code** and **OpenAI Codex CLI** via the [@claude-flow/codex](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@claude-flow/codex) package, following the [Agentics Foundation](https://agentics.org) standard.

### Quick Start for Codex

```bash
# Initialize for Codex CLI (creates AGENTS.md instead of CLAUDE.md)
npx ruflo@alpha init --codex

# Full Codex setup with all 137+ skills
npx ruflo@alpha init --codex --full

# Initialize for both platforms (dual mode)
npx ruflo@alpha init --dual
```

### Platform Comparison

| Feature | Claude Code | OpenAI Codex |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| Config File | `CLAUDE.md` | `AGENTS.md` |
| Skills Dir | `.claude/skills/` | `.agents/skills/` |
| Skill Syntax | `/skill-name` | `$skill-name` |
| Settings | `settings.json` | `config.toml` |
| MCP | Native | Via `codex mcp add` |
| Default Model | claude-sonnet | gpt-5.3 |

### Key Concept: Execution Model

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  CLAUDE-FLOW = ORCHESTRATOR (tracks state, stores memory)       │
│  CODEX = EXECUTOR (writes code, runs commands, implements)      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Codex does the work. Claude-flow coordinates and learns.**

### Dual-Mode Integration (Claude Code + Codex)

Run Claude Code for interactive development and spawn headless Codex workers for parallel background tasks:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  CLAUDE CODE (interactive)  ←→  CODEX WORKERS (headless)        │
│  - Main conversation         - Parallel background execution    │
│  - Complex reasoning         - Bulk code generation            │
│  - Architecture decisions    - Test execution                   │
│  - Final integration         - File processing                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

```bash
# Spawn parallel Codex workers from Claude Code
claude -p "Analyze src/auth/ for security issues" --session-id "task-1" &
claude -p "Write unit tests for src/api/" --session-id "task-2" &
claude -p "Optimize database queries in src/db/" --session-id "task-3" &
wait  # Wait for all to complete
```

| Dual-Mode Feature | Benefit |
|-------------------|---------|
| Parallel Execution | 4-8x faster for bulk tasks |
| Cost Optimization | Route simple tasks to cheaper workers |
| Context Preservation | Shared memory across platforms |
| Best of Both | Interactive + batch processing |

### Dual-Mode CLI Commands (NEW)

```bash
# List collaboration templates
npx ruflo-codex dual templates

# Run feature development swarm (architect → coder → tester → reviewer)
npx ruflo-codex dual run --template feature --task "Add user auth"

# Run security audit swarm (scanner → analyzer → fixer)
npx ruflo-codex dual run --template security --task "src/auth/"

# Run refactoring swarm (analyzer → planner → refactorer → validator)
npx ruflo-codex dual run --template refactor --task "src/legacy/"
```

### Pre-Built Collaboration Templates

| Template | Pipeline | Platforms |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| **feature** | architect → coder → tester → reviewer | Claude + Codex |
| **security** | scanner → analyzer → fixer | Codex + Claude |
| **refactor** | analyzer → planner → refactorer → validator | Claude + Codex |

### MCP Integration for Codex

When you run `init --codex`, the MCP server is automatically registered:

```bash
# Verify MCP is registered
codex mcp list

# If not present, add manually:
codex mcp add ruflo -- npx ruflo mcp start
```

### Self-Learning Workflow

```
1. LEARN:   memory_search(query="task keywords") → Find similar patterns
2. COORD:   swarm_init(topology="hierarchical") → Set up coordination
3. EXECUTE: YOU write code, run commands       → Codex does real work
4. REMEMBER: memory_store(key, value, namespace="patterns") → Save for future
```

The **Intelligence Loop** (ADR-050) automates this cycle through hooks. Each session automatically:
- Builds a knowledge graph from memory entries (PageRank + Jaccard similarity)
- Injects ranked context into every route decision
- Tracks edit patterns and generates new insights
- Boosts confidence for useful patterns, decays unused ones
- Saves snapshots so you can track improvement with `node .claude/helpers/hook-handler.cjs stats`

<summary>💰 <strong>Intelligent 3-Tier Model Routing</strong> — Save 75% on API costs, extend Claude Max 2.5x</summary>

Not every task needs the most powerful (and expensive) model. Ruflo analyzes each request and automatically routes it to the cheapest handler that can do the job well. Simple code transforms skip the LLM entirely using WebAssembly. Medium tasks use faster, cheaper models. Only complex architecture decisions use Opus.

**Cost & Usage Benefits:**

| Benefit | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| 💵 **API Cost Reduction** | 75% lower costs by using right-sized models |
| ⏱️ **Claude Max Extension** | 2.5x more tasks within your quota limits |
| 🚀 **Faster Simple Tasks** | <1ms for transforms vs 2-5s with LLM |
| 🎯 **Zero Wasted Tokens** | Simple edits use 0 tokens (WASM handles them) |

**Routing Tiers:**

| Tier | Handler | Latency | Cost | Use Cases |
|------|---------|---------|------|-----------|
| **1** | Agent Booster (WASM) | <1ms | $0 | Simple transforms: var→const, add-types, remove-console |
| **2** | Haiku/Sonnet | 500ms-2s | $0.0002-$0.003 | Bug fixes, refactoring, feature implementation |
| **3** | Opus | 2-5s | $0.015 | Architecture, security design, distributed systems |

**Benchmark Results:** 100% routing accuracy, 0.57ms avg routing decision latency

</details>

<details>
<summary>📋 <strong>Spec-Driven Development</strong> — Build complete specs, implement without drift</summary>

Complex projects fail when implementation drifts from the original plan. Ruflo solves this with a spec-first approach: define your architecture through ADRs (Architecture Decision Records), organize code into DDD bounded contexts, and let the system enforce compliance as agents work. The result is implementations that match specifications — even across multi-agent swarms working in parallel.

**How It Prevents Drift:**

| Capability | What It Does |
|------------|--------------|
| 🎯 **Spec-First Planning** | Agents generate ADRs before writing code, capturing requirements and decisions |
| 🔍 **Real-Time Compliance** | Statusline shows ADR compliance %, catches deviations immediately |
| 🚧 **Bounded Contexts** | Each domain (Security, Memory, etc.) has clear boundaries agents can't cross |
| ✅ **Validation Gates** | `hooks progress` blocks merges that violate specifications |
| 🔄 **Living Documentation** | ADRs update automatically as requirements evolve |

**Specification Features:**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Architecture Decision Records** | 10 ADRs defining system behavior, integration patterns, and security requirements |
| **Domain-Driven Design** | 5 bounded contexts with clean interfaces preventing cross-domain pollution |
| **Automated Spec Generation** | Agents create specs from requirements using SPARC methodology |
| **Drift Detection** | Continuous monitoring flags when code diverges from spec |
| **Hierarchical Coordination** | Queen agent enforces spec compliance across all worker agents |

**DDD Bounded Contexts:**
```
┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐
│    Core     │  │   Memory    │  │  Security   │
│  Agents,    │  │  AgentDB,   │  │  AIDefence, │
│  Swarms,    │  │  HNSW,      │  │  Validation │

│ flow,MCP    │  │  Hive-Mind  │
└─────────────┘  └─────────────┘
```

**Key ADRs:**
- **ADR-001**: agentic-flow@alpha as foundation (eliminates 10,000+ duplicate lines)
- **ADR-006**: Unified Memory Service with AgentDB
- **ADR-008**: Vitest testing framework (10x faster than Jest)
- **ADR-009**: Hybrid Memory Backend (SQLite + HNSW)

All configurations support these environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Your Anthropic API key | Yes (for Claude models) |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI API key | Optional (for GPT models) |
| `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | Google AI API key | Optional (for Gemini) |
| `CLAUDE_FLOW_LOG_LEVEL` | Logging level (debug, info, warn, error) | Optional |
| `CLAUDE_FLOW_TOOL_GROUPS` | MCP tool groups to enable (comma-separated) | Optional |
| `CLAUDE_FLOW_TOOL_MODE` | Preset tool mode (develop, pr-review, devops, etc.) | Optional |

#### MCP Tool Groups

Control which MCP tools are loaded to reduce latency and token usage:

```bash
# Enable specific tool groups
export CLAUDE_FLOW_TOOL_GROUPS=implement,test,fix,memory

# Or use a preset mode
export CLAUDE_FLOW_TOOL_MODE=develop
```

**Available Groups:** `create`, `issue`, `branch`, `implement`, `test`, `fix`, `optimize`, `monitor`, `security`, `memory`, `all`, `minimal`

**Preset Modes:**
| Mode | Groups | Use Case |
|------|--------|----------|
| `develop` | create, implement, test, fix, memory | Active development |
| `pr-review` | branch, fix, monitor, security | Code review |
| `devops` | create, monitor, optimize, security | Infrastructure |
| `triage` | issue, monitor, fix | Bug triage |

**Precedence:** CLI args (`--tools=X`) > Environment vars > Config file > Default (all)

### Security Best Practices

⚠️ **Never hardcode API keys in config files checked into version control.**

```bash
# Use environment variables instead
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."

# Or use a .env file (add to .gitignore)
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-..." >> .env
```

<summary>🛡️ <strong>@claude-flow/guidance</strong> — Long-horizon governance control plane for Claude Code agents</summary>

### Overview

`@claude-flow/guidance` turns `CLAUDE.md` into a runtime governance system with enforcement gates, cryptographic proofs, and feedback loops. Agents that normally drift after 30 minutes can now operate for days — rules are enforced mechanically at every step, not remembered by the model.

**7-phase pipeline:** Compile → Retrieve → Enforce → Trust → Prove → Defend → Evolve

| Capability | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Compile** | Parses `CLAUDE.md` into typed policy bundles (constitution + task-scoped shards) |
| **Retrieve** | Intent-classified shard retrieval with semantic similarity and risk filters |
| **Enforce** | 4 gates the model cannot bypass (destructive ops, tool allowlist, diff size, secrets) |
| **Trust** | Per-agent trust accumulation with privilege tiers and coherence-driven throttling |
| **Prove** | HMAC-SHA256 hash-chained proof envelopes for cryptographic run auditing |
| **Defend** | Prompt injection, memory poisoning, and inter-agent collusion detection |
| **Evolve** | Optimizer loop that ranks violations, simulates rule changes, and promotes winners |

### Install

```bash
npm install @claude-flow/guidance@alpha
```

### Quick Usage

```typescript
import {
  createCompiler,
  createRetriever,
  createGates,
  createLedger,
  createProofChain,
} from '@claude-flow/guidance';

// Compile CLAUDE.md into a policy bundle
const compiler = createCompiler();
const bundle = await compiler.compile(claudeMdText);

// Retrieve task-relevant rules
const retriever = createRetriever();
await retriever.loadBundle(bundle);
const { shards, policyText } = await retriever.retrieve({
  taskDescription: 'Fix authentication bug in login flow',
});

// Enforce gates on tool calls
const gates = createGates(bundle);
const result = gates.evaluate({ tool: 'bash', args: { command: 'rm -rf /' } });
// result.blocked === true

// Audit with proof chain
const chain = createProofChain({ signingKey: process.env.PROOF_KEY! });
const envelope = chain.seal(runEvent);
chain.verify(envelope); // true — tamper-evident
```

### Key Modules

| Import Path | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| `@claude-flow/guidance` | Main entry — GuidanceControlPlane |
| `@claude-flow/guidance/compiler` | CLAUDE.md → PolicyBundle compiler |
| `@claude-flow/guidance/retriever` | Intent classification + shard retrieval |
| `@claude-flow/guidance/gates` | 4 enforcement gates |
| `@claude-flow/guidance/ledger` | Run event logging + evaluators |
| `@claude-flow/guidance/proof` | HMAC-SHA256 proof chain |
| `@claude-flow/guidance/adversarial` | Threat, collusion, memory quorum |
| `@claude-flow/guidance/trust` | Trust accumulation + privilege tiers |
| `@claude-flow/guidance/authority` | Human authority + irreversibility classification |
| `@claude-flow/guidance/wasm-kernel` | WASM-accelerated security-critical paths |
| `@claude-flow/guidance/analyzer` | CLAUDE.md quality analysis + A/B benchmarking |
| `@claude-flow/guidance/conformance-kit` | Headless conformance test runner |

### Stats

<summary>📊 <strong>V3 Statusline</strong> — Real-time development status for Claude Code</summary>

Real-time development status display integrated directly into Claude Code's status bar. Shows DDD progress, swarm activity, security status, AgentDB metrics, and live session data (model, context usage, cost).

**How It Works:**

Claude Code pipes JSON session data via **stdin** to the statusline script after each assistant message (debounced ~300ms). The script reads this data and combines it with local project metrics to produce a single-line status output.

**Output Format:**
```
▊ Claude Flow V3 ● ruvnet  │  ⎇ main  │  Opus 4.6  | ●42% ctx  | $0.15
🏗️ DDD [●●●●○] 4/5  ⚡ HNSW 150x  🤖 ◉ [12/8]  👥 3  🟢 CVE 3/3  💾 512MB  🧠 15%  📦 AgentDB ●1.2K vectors
```

| Indicator | Description | Source |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| `▊ Claude Flow V3` | Project header | Always shown |
| `● ruvnet` | GitHub user | `gh api user` CLI |
| `⎇ main` | Current git branch | `git branch --show-current` |
| `Opus 4.6` | Claude model name | Stdin JSON `model.display_name` |
| `●42% ctx` | Context window usage | Stdin JSON `context_window.used_percentage` |
| `$0.15` | Session cost | Stdin JSON `cost.total_cost_usd` |
| `[●●●●○]` | DDD domain progress bar | `.claude-flow/metrics/v3-progress.json` |
| `⚡ HNSW 150x` | HNSW search speedup | AgentDB file stats |
| `◉/○` | Swarm coordination status | Process detection |
| `[12/8]` | Active agents / max agents | `ps aux` process count |
| `👥 3` | Sub-agents spawned | Task tool agent count |
| `🟢 CVE 3/3` | Security CVE remediation | `.claude-flow/security/audit-status.json` |
| `💾 512MB` | Memory usage | Node.js process RSS |
| `🧠 15%` | Intelligence score | Pattern count from AgentDB |
| `📦 AgentDB ●1.2K` | AgentDB vector count | File size estimate (`size / 2KB`) |

**Setup (Automatic):**

Run `npx claude-flow@v3alpha init` — this generates `.claude/settings.json` with the correct statusline config and creates the helper script at `.claude/helpers/statusline.cjs`.

The generated config uses a **fast local script** (no `npx` cold-start):
```json
{
  "statusLine": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "node .claude/helpers/statusline.cjs"
  }
}
```

> **Note:** Only `type`, `command`, and `padding` are valid statusLine fields. Do not add `refreshMs`, `enabled`, or other fields — Claude Code will ignore them.

**For Existing Users:**

If your statusline is not updating, run the upgrade command to regenerate helpers and fix the config:
```bash
npx claude-flow@v3alpha init --update --settings
```

This removes invalid config fields and regenerates the statusline helper with stdin support.

**Stdin JSON Protocol:**

Claude Code provides session data via stdin in this format:
```json
{
  "model": { "display_name": "Opus 4.6" },
  "context_window": { "used_percentage": 42, "remaining_percentage": 58 },
  "cost": { "total_cost_usd": 0.15, "total_duration_ms": 45000 },
  "workspace": { "current_dir": "/path/to/project" },
  "session_id": "abc-123"
}
```

The statusline script reads stdin synchronously, falls back to local detection when run manually (TTY mode).

**Data Sources:**
- **Stdin JSON** — Model name, context %, cost, duration (from Claude Code)
- `.claude-flow/metrics/v3-progress.json` — DDD domain progress
- `.claude-flow/metrics/swarm-activity.json` — Active agent counts
- `.claude-flow/security/audit-status.json` — CVE remediation status
- **AgentDB files** — Vector count (estimated from file size), HNSW index status
- Process detection via `ps aux` — Real-time memory and agent counts
- Git branch via `git branch --show-current`
- GitHub user via `gh api user`

## 🧠 Infinite Context & Memory Optimization

Ruflo eliminates Claude Code's context window ceiling with a real-time memory management system that archives, optimizes, and restores conversation context automatically.

<details>
<summary>♾️ <strong>Context Autopilot</strong> — Never lose context to compaction again</summary>

### The Problem

Claude Code has a finite context window (~200K tokens). When full, it **compacts** — summarizing the conversation and discarding details like exact file paths, tool outputs, decision reasoning, and code snippets. This creates a "context cliff" where Claude loses the ability to reference earlier work.

### The Solution: Context Autopilot (ADR-051)

Ruflo intercepts the compaction lifecycle with three hooks that make context loss invisible:

```
Every Prompt                    Context Full                    After Compact
     │                              │                              │
     ▼                              ▼                              ▼
UserPromptSubmit              PreCompact                     SessionStart
     │                              │                              │
 Archive turns              Archive + BLOCK              Restore from archive
 to SQLite                  auto-compaction               via additionalContext
 (incremental)              (exit code 2)                (importance-ranked)
     │                              │                              │
     ▼                              ▼                              ▼
 Track tokens              Manual /compact               Seamless continuation
 Report % used             still allowed                 with full history
```

### How Memory is Optimized

| Layer | What It Does | When |
|-------|-------------|------|
| **Proactive Archiving** | Every user prompt archives new turns to SQLite with SHA-256 dedup | Every prompt |
| **Token Tracking** | Reads actual API `usage` data (input + cache tokens) for accurate % | Every prompt |
| **Compaction Blocking** | PreCompact hook returns exit code 2 to cancel auto-compaction | When context fills |
| **Manual Compact** | `/compact` is allowed — archives first, resets autopilot, then compresses | On user request |
| **Importance Ranking** | Entries scored by `recency × frequency × richness` for smart retrieval | On restore |
| **Access Tracking** | Restored entries get access_count++ creating a relevance feedback loop | On restore |
| **Auto-Pruning** | Never-accessed entries older than 30 days are automatically removed | On PreCompact |
| **Content Compaction** | Old session entries trimmed to summaries, reducing archive storage | Manual or scheduled |
| **RuVector Sync** | SQLite entries auto-replicated to PostgreSQL when configured | On PreCompact |

### Optimization Thresholds

| Zone | Threshold | Statusline | Action |
|------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| OK | <70% | `🛡️ 43% 86.7K ⊘` (green) | Normal operation, track growth trend |
| Warning | 70-85% | `🛡️ 72% 144K ⊘` (yellow) | Flag approaching limit, archive aggressively |
| Optimize | 85%+ | `🛡️ 88% 176K ⟳2` (red) | Prune stale entries, keep responses concise |

### Real-Time Statusline

The statusline shows live context metrics read from `autopilot-state.json`:

```
🛡️  45% 89.2K ⊘  🧠 86%
│    │   │     │    │   │
│    │   │     │    │   └─ Intelligence score (learning.json + patterns + archive)
│    │   │     │    └──── Intelligence indicator
│    │   │     └───────── No prune cycles (⊘) or prune count (⟳N)
│    │   └─────────────── Token count (actual API usage)
│    └─────────────────── Context percentage used
└──────────────────────── Autopilot active (shield icon)
```

### Storage Tiers

| Tier | Backend | Storage | Features |
|------|---------|---------|----------|
| 1 | **SQLite** (default) | `.claude-flow/data/transcript-archive.db` | WAL mode, indexed queries, ACID, importance ranking |
| 2 | **RuVector PostgreSQL** | Configurable remote | TB-scale, pgvector embeddings, GNN search |
| 3 | **AgentDB + HNSW** | In-memory + persist | 150x-12,500x faster semantic search |
| 4 | **JSON** (fallback) | `.claude-flow/data/transcript-archive.json` | Zero dependencies, always works |

### Configuration

```bash
# Context Autopilot (all have sensible defaults)
CLAUDE_FLOW_CONTEXT_AUTOPILOT=true        # Enable/disable autopilot (default: true)
CLAUDE_FLOW_CONTEXT_WINDOW=200000         # Context window size in tokens
CLAUDE_FLOW_AUTOPILOT_WARN=0.70           # Warning threshold (70%)
CLAUDE_FLOW_AUTOPILOT_PRUNE=0.85          # Optimization threshold (85%)
CLAUDE_FLOW_COMPACT_RESTORE_BUDGET=4000   # Max chars restored after compaction
CLAUDE_FLOW_RETENTION_DAYS=30             # Auto-prune never-accessed entries
CLAUDE_FLOW_AUTO_OPTIMIZE=true            # Importance ranking + pruning + sync
```

### Commands

```bash
# Check archive status and autopilot state
node .claude/helpers/context-persistence-hook.mjs status

# Manual compact (archives first, then allows Claude Code to compress)
# Use /compact in Claude Code — autopilot allows manual, blocks auto

# Query archive directly
sqlite3 .claude-flow/data/transcript-archive.db \
  "SELECT COUNT(*), SUM(LENGTH(content)) FROM transcript_entries;"
```

## 🧠 Intelligence & Learning

Self-learning hooks, pattern recognition, and intelligent task routing.

<details>
<summary>🪝 <strong>Hooks, Event Hooks, Workers & Pattern Intelligence</strong></summary>

### What Are Hooks?

Hooks intercept operations (file edits, commands, tasks) and learn from outcomes. Unlike static automation, hooks **improve over time** by tracking what works and applying those patterns to future tasks.

| Concept | Plain English | Technical Details |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Hook** | Code that runs before/after an action | Event listener with pre/post lifecycle |
| **Pattern** | A learned strategy that worked | Vector embedding stored in ReasoningBank |
| **Trajectory** | Recording of actions → outcomes | RL episode for SONA training |
| **Routing** | Picking the best agent for a task | MoE-based classifier with learned weights |

### How Hooks Learn (4-Step Pipeline)

```
┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐
│  RETRIEVE   │───▶│    JUDGE    │───▶│   DISTILL   │───▶│ CONSOLIDATE │

   150x faster        success/fail      compression       memory lock
```

### Hook Signals (ADR-026 Model Routing)

When hooks run, they emit signals that guide routing decisions. Watch for these in hook output:

| Signal | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `[AGENT_BOOSTER_AVAILABLE]` | Simple transform detected, skip LLM | Use Edit tool directly (352x faster, $0) |
| `[TASK_MODEL_RECOMMENDATION] Use model="haiku"` | Low complexity task | Pass `model: "haiku"` to Task tool |
| `[TASK_MODEL_RECOMMENDATION] Use model="sonnet"` | Medium complexity task | Pass `model: "sonnet"` to Task tool |
| `[TASK_MODEL_RECOMMENDATION] Use model="opus"` | High complexity task | Pass `model: "opus"` to Task tool |

**Agent Booster Intents** (handled without LLM):
- `var-to-const` - Convert var/let to const
- `add-types` - Add TypeScript type annotations
- `add-error-handling` - Wrap in try/catch
- `async-await` - Convert promises to async/await
- `add-logging` - Add console.log statements
- `remove-console` - Strip console.* calls

**Example Hook Output:**
```bash
$ npx ruflo@v3alpha hooks pre-task --description "convert var to const in utils.ts"

[AGENT_BOOSTER_AVAILABLE] Intent: var-to-const
Recommendation: Use Edit tool directly
Performance: <1ms (352x faster than LLM)
Cost: $0
```

### Intelligence Loop (ADR-050)

The intelligence loop wires PageRank-ranked memory into the hook system. Every session builds a knowledge graph that improves over time:

```
SessionStart:
  session-restore  → intelligence.init()
    → Read MEMORY.md / auto-memory-store.json
    → Build graph (nodes + similarity/temporal edges)
    → Compute PageRank
    → "[INTELLIGENCE] Loaded 13 patterns, 12 edges"

UserPrompt:
  route            → intelligence.getContext(prompt)
    → Jaccard-match prompt against pre-ranked entries
    → Inject top-5 patterns into Claude's context:

    [INTELLIGENCE] Relevant patterns for this task:
      * (0.95) HNSW gives 150x-12,500x speedup [rank #1, 12x accessed]
      * (0.88) London School TDD preferred [rank #3, 8x accessed]

PostEdit:
  post-edit        → intelligence.recordEdit(file)
    → Append to pending-insights.jsonl (<2ms)

SessionEnd:
  session-end      → intelligence.consolidate()
    → Process pending insights (3+ edits → new entry)
    → Confidence boost for accessed patterns (+0.03)
    → Confidence decay for unused patterns (-0.005/day)
    → Recompute PageRank, rebuild edges
    → Save snapshot for trend tracking
```

**Measuring improvement:**

```bash
# Human-readable diagnostics
node .claude/helpers/hook-handler.cjs stats

# JSON output for scripting
node .claude/helpers/hook-handler.cjs stats --json

# Or via intelligence.cjs directly
node .claude/helpers/intelligence.cjs stats
```

The stats command shows:

| Section | What It Tells You |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Graph** | Node/edge count, density % |
| **Confidence** | Min/max/mean/median across all patterns |
| **Access** | Total accesses, patterns used vs never accessed |
| **PageRank** | Sum (~1.0), highest-ranked node |
| **Top Patterns** | Top 10 by composite score with access counts |
| **Last Delta** | Changes since previous session (confidence shift, access delta) |
| **Trend** | Over all sessions: IMPROVING / DECLINING / STABLE |

<summary>🎫 <strong>Claims & Work Coordination</strong> — Human-Agent Task Management</summary>

The Claims system manages **who is working on what** — whether human or agent. It prevents conflicts, enables handoffs, and balances work across your team.

### Why Use Claims?

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Two agents working on the same file | Claims prevent duplicate work |
| Agent stuck on a task | Mark as stealable, another agent takes over |
| Need to hand off work | Structured handoff with context |
| Unbalanced workload | Automatic rebalancing across agents |

### How Claims Work

```

### Route Commands

| Command | What It Does | Example |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| `route task` | Get agent recommendation | `npx ruflo@v3alpha route task "implement OAuth2"` |
| `route explain` | Understand routing decision | `npx ruflo@v3alpha route explain "task"` |
| `route coverage` | Route based on test coverage | `npx ruflo@v3alpha route coverage` |

### Example: Route a Task

```bash
npx ruflo@v3alpha route task "refactor authentication to use JWT"

# Output:
# ╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
# ║                    ROUTING RECOMMENDATION                     ║
# ╠══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣
# ║ Task: "refactor authentication to use JWT"                    ║
# ║                                                                ║
# ║ Recommended Agent: security-architect                         ║
# ║ Confidence: 94%                                                ║
# ║                                                                ║
# ║ Why this agent?                                                ║
# ║ • Domain match: authentication, security                       ║
# ║ • Historical success: 12/13 similar tasks (92%)                ║
# ║ • Expertise: JWT, OAuth, session management                    ║
# ║                                                                ║
# ║ Alternative agents:                                            ║
# ║ • coder (78% confidence) - general implementation              ║
# ║ • backend-dev (71% confidence) - API expertise                 ║
# ╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

### Coverage-Aware Routing

Routes tasks to agents based on **test coverage gaps**:

```bash
npx ruflo@v3alpha route coverage

# Finds untested code and routes to tester agent:
# • src/auth/jwt.ts - 23% coverage → tester
# • src/api/users.ts - 45% coverage → tester
# • src/utils/crypto.ts - 0% coverage → security-architect + tester
```

### Routing Hooks

```bash
# Route via hooks (preferred)
npx ruflo@v3alpha hooks route "implement caching layer" --include-explanation

# Record outcome for learning
npx ruflo@v3alpha hooks post-task --task-id "task-123" --success true --agent coder
```

### How Q-Learning Improves Over Time

| Iteration | Action | Result |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Route "auth task" → coder | ❌ Failed (missing security context) |
| 2 | Route "auth task" → security-architect | ✅ Success |
| 3 | Route "auth task" → security-architect | ✅ Success |
| N | Route "auth task" → security-architect | 94% confidence (learned) |

The system **remembers** what works and applies it to future similar tasks.

<summary>📊 <strong>Embeddings — Multi-Provider with Fine-Tuning & Hyperbolic Space</strong></summary>

### Provider Comparison

| Provider | Latency | Quality | Cost | Offline | Best For |
|----------|---------|---------|------|---------|----------|
| **Agentic-Flow (ONNX)** | ~3ms | Good | Free | ✅ | Production (75x faster) |
| **OpenAI** | ~50-100ms | Excellent | $0.02-0.13/1M | ❌ | Highest quality |
| **Transformers.js** | ~230ms | Good | Free | ✅ | Local development |
| **Mock** | <1ms | N/A | Free | ✅ | Testing |

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { createEmbeddingService, cosineSimilarity } from '@claude-flow/embeddings';

// Auto-selects best provider (agentic-flow ONNX preferred)
const embeddings = await createEmbeddingService({
  provider: 'auto',        // agentic-flow → transformers → mock
  autoInstall: true,       // Auto-install agentic-flow if missing
  dimensions: 384,
  cache: { enabled: true, maxSize: 10000 }
});

// Generate embeddings
const result = await embeddings.embed('authentication patterns');
console.log(`Generated in ${result.latencyMs}ms`);

// Batch processing with cache stats
const batch = await embeddings.embedBatch([
  'user login flow',
  'password reset',
  'session management'
]);
console.log(`Cache hits: ${batch.cacheStats?.hits}`);

// Compare similarity
const similarity = cosineSimilarity(batch.embeddings[0], batch.embeddings[1]);
// 0.94 (high similarity)
```

### Document Chunking

Split long documents into overlapping chunks:

```typescript
import { chunkText, estimateTokens } from '@claude-flow/embeddings';

const result = chunkText(longDocument, {
  maxChunkSize: 512,
  overlap: 50,
  strategy: 'sentence',  // 'character' | 'sentence' | 'paragraph' | 'token'
  minChunkSize: 100,
});

console.log(`Created ${result.totalChunks} chunks`);
result.chunks.forEach((chunk, i) => {
  console.log(`Chunk ${i}: ${chunk.length} chars, ~${chunk.tokenCount} tokens`);
});
```

### Normalization Options

Normalize embeddings for consistent similarity:

```typescript
import { l2Normalize, l1Normalize, minMaxNormalize, zScoreNormalize } from '@claude-flow/embeddings';

// L2 normalize (unit vector - most common for cosine similarity)
const l2 = l2Normalize(embedding);  // [0.6, 0.8, 0]

// Other normalizations
const l1 = l1Normalize(embedding);       // Manhattan norm = 1
const minMax = minMaxNormalize(embedding); // Values in [0, 1]
const zScore = zScoreNormalize(embedding); // Mean 0, std 1
```

### Hyperbolic Embeddings (Poincaré Ball)

Better representation for hierarchical code structures:

```typescript
import {
  euclideanToPoincare,
  hyperbolicDistance,
  hyperbolicCentroid,
  mobiusAdd,
} from '@claude-flow/embeddings';

// Convert to hyperbolic space (better for tree-like structures)
const poincare = euclideanToPoincare(embedding);

// Hyperbolic distance (geodesic in Poincaré ball)
const dist = hyperbolicDistance(embedding1, embedding2);

// Hyperbolic centroid (Fréchet mean)
const centroid = hyperbolicCentroid([embed1, embed2, embed3]);

// Why hyperbolic? Better for:
// - Parent-child relationships (class inheritance)
// - Directory hierarchies
// - Taxonomy structures
// - Lower distortion for tree-like data
```

### Neural Substrate Integration (Fine-Tuning)

Access neural features for embedding adaptation:

```typescript
import { createNeuralService, isNeuralAvailable } from '@claude-flow/embeddings';

// Check availability
const available = await isNeuralAvailable();

// Create neural service
const neural = createNeuralService({ dimension: 384 });
await neural.init();

if (neural.isAvailable()) {
  // Semantic drift detection (catches context drift)
  await neural.setDriftBaseline('Initial context');
  const drift = await neural.detectDrift('New input to check');
  console.log('Drift:', drift?.trend);  // 'stable' | 'drifting' | 'accelerating'

  // Memory with interference detection
  const stored = await neural.storeMemory('mem-1', 'Important pattern');

## 🔗 Ecosystem & Integrations

Core infrastructure packages powering Ruflo's intelligence layer.

<details>
<summary>⚡ <strong>Agentic-Flow Integration</strong> — Core AI Infrastructure</summary>

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/agentic-flow?color=blue&label=npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/agentic-flow)
[![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/agentic-flow?color=green)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/agentic-flow)
[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-ruvnet%2Fagentic--flow-blue?logo=github)](https://github.com/ruvnet/agentic-flow)

Ruflo v3 is built on top of **[agentic-flow](https://github.com/ruvnet/agentic-flow)**, a production-ready AI agent orchestration platform. This deep integration provides 352x faster code transformations, learning memory, and geometric intelligence.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g agentic-flow

# Or run directly with npx
npx agentic-flow --help

# Start MCP server
npx agentic-flow mcp start

# Add to Claude Code
claude mcp add agentic-flow -- npx agentic-flow mcp start
```

### Core Components

| Component | Description | Performance |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Agent Booster** | Rust/WASM code transformations | 352x faster, $0 cost |
| **ReasoningBank** | Learning memory with HNSW | 150x-12,500x search |
| **ONNX Embeddings** | Local vector generation | 75x faster than Transformers.js |
| **Embedding Geometry** | Geometric intelligence layer | <3ms latency |
| **Multi-Model Router** | Intelligent model selection | 30-50% cost savings |
| **QUIC Transport** | High-performance transport | Ultra-low latency |

<details>
<summary>⚡ <strong>Agent Booster</strong> — 352x Faster Code Transformations</summary>

Agent Booster performs mechanical code edits without calling LLM APIs:

| Operation | LLM API | Agent Booster | Speedup |
|-----------|---------|---------------|---------|
| Variable rename | 352ms | 1ms | **352x** |
| Add import | 420ms | 1ms | **420x** |
| Function signature | 380ms | 1ms | **380x** |
| Code formatting | 290ms | 1ms | **290x** |
| **1000 files** | 5.87 min | 1 second | **352x** |

```bash
# Single file edit
npx agentic-flow agent-booster edit \
  --file src/api.ts \
  --instructions "Add error handling" \
  --code 'try { ... } catch (error) { ... }'

# Batch rename across codebase
npx agentic-flow agent-booster batch-rename \
  --pattern "getUserData" \
  --replacement "fetchUserProfile" \
  --glob "src/**/*.ts"

# Parse LLM markdown output
npx agentic-flow agent-booster parse-md response.md
```

**Use Cases:**
- ✅ Variable/function renaming across files
- ✅ Adding imports, type annotations
- ✅ Code formatting, signature updates
- ❌ Complex refactoring (use LLM)
- ❌ Bug fixes requiring reasoning (use LLM)

**ROI Example:** 1000 edits/day saves $10/day + 5.86 minutes = **$3,650/year**

</details>

<details>
<summary>🧠 <strong>ReasoningBank</strong> — Learning Memory System</summary>

ReasoningBank stores successful patterns for future retrieval:

```typescript
import { ReasoningBank } from 'agentic-flow/reasoningbank';

const bank = new ReasoningBank();

// Record successful outcome
await bank.recordOutcome({
  task: 'implement authentication',
  outcome: 'JWT with refresh tokens',
  success: true,
  context: { framework: 'express' }
});

// Retrieve similar patterns for new task
const patterns = await bank.retrieveSimilar('add user login', { k: 5 });
// Returns past successful auth implementations

// Judge and distill learnings
await bank.judge(trajectoryId, 'success');
await bank.distill();  // Extract key patterns
await bank.consolidate();  // Prevent forgetting (EWC++)
```

**4-Step Pipeline:**
1. **RETRIEVE** — Fetch relevant patterns via HNSW (150x faster)
2. **JUDGE** — Evaluate outcomes with verdicts
3. **DISTILL** — Extract key learnings via LoRA
4. **CONSOLIDATE** — Prevent catastrophic forgetting (EWC++)

</details>

<details>
<summary>🔢 <strong>ONNX Embeddings</strong> — 75x Faster Local Vectors</summary>

Generate embeddings locally without API calls:

```typescript
import { getOptimizedEmbedder, cosineSimilarity } from 'agentic-flow/embeddings';

const embedder = getOptimizedEmbedder();
await embedder.init();

// Generate embedding (3ms local vs 230ms Transformers.js)
const vector = await embedder.embed('authentication patterns');

// Batch processing
const vectors = await embedder.embedBatch([
  'user login flow',
  'password reset',
  'session management'
]);

// Calculate similarity
const similarity = cosineSimilarity(vectors[0], vectors[1]);
```

| Provider | Latency | Cost | Offline |
|----------|---------|------|---------|
| **Agentic-Flow ONNX** | ~3ms | Free | ✅ |
| Transformers.js | ~230ms | Free | ✅ |
| OpenAI | ~50-100ms | $0.02-0.13/1M | ❌ |

</details>

<details>
<summary>📐 <strong>Embedding Geometry</strong> — Intelligence as Geometry</summary>

Advanced patterns treating embeddings as geometric control surfaces:

**Semantic Drift Detection:**
```typescript
import { getOptimizedEmbedder, cosineSimilarity } from 'agentic-flow/embeddings';

const embedder = getOptimizedEmbedder();
let baseline: Float32Array;

// Set baseline context
baseline = await embedder.embed('User asking about API authentication');

// Check for drift
const current = await embedder.embed(userMessage);
const drift = 1 - cosineSimilarity(baseline, current);

if (drift > 0.15) {
  console.log('Semantic drift detected - escalate');
}
```

**Memory Physics:**
- Temporal decay (forgetting)
- Interference detection (nearby memories weaken)
- Memory consolidation (merge similar patterns)

**Swarm Coordination:**
```typescript
// Agents coordinate via embedding positions, not messages
const agentPosition = await embedder.embed(agentRole);
const taskPosition = await embedder.embed(currentTask);

// Geometric alignment for task routing
const alignment = cosineSimilarity(agentPosition, taskPosition);
```

**Coherence Monitoring:**
```typescript
// Detect model degradation/poisoning via embedding drift
await monitor.calibrate(knownGoodOutputs);
const result = await monitor.check(newOutput);
if (result.anomalyScore > 1.5) {
  console.log('WARNING: Output drifting from baseline');
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>🔀 <strong>Multi-Model Router</strong> — Intelligent Model Selection</summary>

Route tasks to optimal models based on complexity:

```typescript
import { ModelRouter } from 'agentic-flow/router';

const router = new ModelRouter();

// Automatic routing based on task complexity
const result = await router.route({
  task: 'Add console.log to function',
  preferCost: true
});
// Returns: { model: 'haiku', reason: 'simple task, low complexity' }

const result2 = await router.route({
  task: 'Design distributed caching architecture'
});
// Returns: { model: 'opus', reason: 'complex architecture, high reasoning' }
```

| Complexity | Model | Cost | Use Case |
|------------|-------|------|----------|
| Agent Booster intent | **Skip LLM** | $0 | var→const, add-types |
| Low (<30%) | **Haiku** | $0.0002 | Simple fixes, docs |
| Medium (30-70%) | **Sonnet** | $0.003 | Features, debugging |
| High (>70%) | **Opus** | $0.015 | Architecture, security |

**Savings: 30-50% on LLM costs through intelligent routing**

<summary>⚡ <strong>@ruvector/attention</strong> — Flash Attention (2.49x-7.47x Speedup)</summary>

Native Rust implementation of Flash Attention for transformer computations:

```typescript
import { FlashAttention } from '@ruvector/attention';

const attention = new FlashAttention({
  blockSize: 32,      // L1 cache optimized
  dimensions: 384,
  temperature: 1.0,
  useCPUOptimizations: true
});

// Compute attention with O(N) memory instead of O(N²)
const result = attention.attention(queries, keys, values);
console.log(`Computed in ${result.computeTimeMs}ms`);

// Benchmark against naive implementation
const bench = attention.benchmark(512, 384, 5);
console.log(`Speedup: ${bench.speedup}x`);
console.log(`Memory reduction: ${bench.memoryReduction}x`);
```

**Key Optimizations:**
- Block-wise computation (fits L1 cache)
- 8x loop unrolling for dot products
- Top-K sparse attention (12% of keys)
- Two-stage screening for large key sets
- Online softmax for numerical stability

</details>

<details>
<summary>🧠 <strong>@ruvector/sona</strong> — Self-Optimizing Neural Architecture</summary>

SONA provides runtime-adaptive learning with minimal overhead:

```typescript
import { SONA } from '@ruvector/sona';

const sona = new SONA({
  enableLoRA: true,       // Low-rank adaptation
  enableEWC: true,        // Elastic Weight Consolidation
  learningRate: 0.001
});

// Start learning trajectory
const trajectory = sona.startTrajectory('task-123');

// Record steps during execution
trajectory.recordStep({
  type: 'observation',
  content: 'Found authentication bug'
});
trajectory.recordStep({
  type: 'action',
  content: 'Applied JWT validation fix'
});

// Complete trajectory with verdict
await trajectory.complete('success');

// EWC++ consolidation (prevents forgetting)
await sona.consolidate();
```

**Features:**
- **LoRA**: Low-rank adaptation for efficient fine-tuning
- **EWC++**: Prevents catastrophic forgetting
- **ReasoningBank**: Pattern storage with similarity search
- **Sub-millisecond**: <0.05ms adaptation overhead

</details>

<details>
<summary>📊 <strong>@ruvector/graph-node</strong> — Native Graph Database</summary>

High-performance graph database with Cypher query support:

```typescript
import { GraphDB } from '@ruvector/graph-node';

const db = new GraphDB({ path: './data/graph' });

// Create nodes and relationships
await db.query(`
  CREATE (a:Agent {name: 'coder', type: 'specialist'})
  CREATE (b:Agent {name: 'reviewer', type: 'specialist'})
  CREATE (a)-[:COLLABORATES_WITH {weight: 0.9}]->(b)
`);

// Query patterns
const result = await db.query(`
  MATCH (a:Agent)-[r:COLLABORATES_WITH]->(b:Agent)
  WHERE r.weight > 0.8
  RETURN a.name, b.name, r.weight
`);

// Hypergraph support for multi-agent coordination
await db.createHyperedge(['agent-1', 'agent-2', 'agent-3'], {
  type: 'consensus',
  topic: 'architecture-decision'
});
```

**Performance vs WASM:**
- 10x faster query execution
- Native memory management
- Zero-copy data transfer

</details>

### Integration with Ruflo

Ruflo automatically uses RuVector when available:

```typescript
// Ruflo detects and uses native ruvector
import { getVectorStore } from '@claude-flow/memory';

const store = await getVectorStore();
// Uses ruvector if installed, falls back to sql.js

// HNSW-indexed search (150x faster)
const results = await store.search(queryVector, 10);

// Flash Attention for pattern matching
const attention = await getFlashAttention();
const similarity = attention.attention(queries, keys, values);
```

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "pre-agent-input": {
      "command": "node -e \"const { isSafe } = require('@claude-flow/aidefence'); if (!isSafe(process.env.AGENT_INPUT)) { process.exit(1); }\"",
      "timeout": 5000
    }
  }
}
```

```

### Quick Start

```typescript
import {
  setupV3Tests,
  createMockApplication,
  agentConfigs,
  swarmConfigs,
  waitFor,
} from '@claude-flow/testing';

// Configure test environment
setupV3Tests();

describe('MyModule', () => {
  const app = createMockApplication();

  beforeEach(() => {
    vi.clearAllMocks();
  });

  it('should spawn an agent', async () => {
    const result = await app.agentLifecycle.spawn(agentConfigs.queenCoordinator);

    expect(result.success).toBe(true);
    expect(result.agent.type).toBe('queen-coordinator');
  });
});
```

### Fixtures

#### Agent Fixtures

```typescript
import {
  agentConfigs,
  createAgentConfig,
  createV3SwarmAgentConfigs,
  createMockAgent,
} from '@claude-flow/testing';

// Pre-defined configs
const queen = agentConfigs.queenCoordinator;
const coder = agentConfigs.coder;

// Create with overrides
const customAgent = createAgentConfig('coder', {
  name: 'Custom Coder',
  priority: 90,
});

// Full V3 15-agent swarm
const swarmAgents = createV3SwarmAgentConfigs();

// Mock agents with vitest mocks
const mockAgent = createMockAgent('security-architect');
mockAgent.execute.mockResolvedValue({ success: true });
```

#### Memory Fixtures

```typescript
import {
  memoryEntries,
  createMemoryEntry,
  generateMockEmbedding,
  createMemoryBatch,
} from '@claude-flow/testing';

// Pre-defined entries
const pattern = memoryEntries.agentPattern;
const securityRule = memoryEntries.securityRule;

// Generate embeddings
const embedding = generateMockEmbedding(384, 'my-seed');

// Create batch for performance testing
const batch = createMemoryBatch(10000, 'semantic');
```

#### Swarm Fixtures

```typescript
import {
  swarmConfigs,
  createSwarmConfig,
  createSwarmTask,
  createMockSwarmCoordinator,
} from '@claude-flow/testing';

// Pre-defined configs
const v3Config = swarmConfigs.v3Default;
const minimalConfig = swarmConfigs.minimal;

// Create with overrides
const customConfig = createSwarmConfig('v3Default', {
  maxAgents: 20,
  coordination: {
    consensusProtocol: 'pbft',
    heartbeatInterval: 500,
  },
});

// Mock coordinator
const coordinator = createMockSwarmCoordinator();
await coordinator.initialize(v3Config);
```

#### MCP Fixtures

```typescript
import {
  mcpTools,
  createMCPTool,
  createMockMCPClient,
} from '@claude-flow/testing';

// Pre-defined tools
const swarmInit = mcpTools.swarmInit;
const agentSpawn = mcpTools.agentSpawn;

// Mock client
const client = createMockMCPClient();
await client.connect();
const result = await client.callTool('swarm_init', { topology: 'mesh' });
```

### Mock Factory

```typescript
import {
  createMockApplication,
  createMockEventBus,
  createMockTaskManager,
  createMockSecurityService,
  createMockSwarmCoordinator,
} from '@claude-flow/testing';

// Full application with all mocks
const app = createMockApplication();

// Use in tests
await app.taskManager.create({ name: 'Test', type: 'coding', payload: {} });
expect(app.taskManager.create).toHaveBeenCalled();

// Access tracked state
expect(app.eventBus.publishedEvents).toHaveLength(1);
expect(app.taskManager.tasks.size).toBe(1);
```

### Async Utilities

```typescript
import {
  waitFor,
  waitUntilChanged,
  retry,
  withTimeout,
  parallelLimit,
} from '@claude-flow/testing';

// Wait for condition
await waitFor(() => element.isVisible(), { timeout: 5000 });

// Wait for value to change
await waitUntilChanged(() => counter.value, { from: 0 });

// Retry with exponential backoff
const result = await retry(
  async () => await fetchData(),
  { maxAttempts: 3, backoff: 100 }
);

// Timeout wrapper
await withTimeout(async () => await longOp(), 5000);

// Parallel with concurrency limit
const results = await parallelLimit(
  items.map(item => () => processItem(item)),
  5 // max 5 concurrent
);
```

### Assertions

```typescript
import {
  assertEventPublished,
  assertEventOrder,
  assertMocksCalledInOrder,
  assertV3PerformanceTargets,
  assertNoSensitiveData,
} from '@claude-flow/testing';

// Event assertions
assertEventPublished(mockEventBus, 'UserCreated', { userId: '123' });
assertEventOrder(mockEventBus.publish, ['UserCreated', 'EmailSent']);

// Mock order
assertMocksCalledInOrder([mockValidate, mockSave, mockNotify]);

// Performance targets
assertV3PerformanceTargets({
  searchSpeedup: 160,
  flashAttentionSpeedup: 3.5,
  memoryReduction: 0.55,
});

// Security
assertNoSensitiveData(mockLogger.logs, ['password', 'token', 'secret']);
```

### Performance Testing

```typescript
import { createPerformanceTestHelper, TEST_CONFIG } from '@claude-flow/testing';

const perf = createPerformanceTestHelper();

perf.startMeasurement('search');
await search(query);
const duration = perf.endMeasurement('search');

// Get statistics
const stats = perf.getStats('search');
console.log(`Avg: ${stats.avg}ms, P95: ${stats.p95}ms`);

// V3 targets
console.log(TEST_CONFIG.FLASH_ATTENTION_SPEEDUP_MIN); // 2.49
console.log(TEST_CONFIG.AGENTDB_SEARCH_IMPROVEMENT_MAX); // 12500
```

### Best Practices

| Practice | Do | Don't |
|----------|-----|-------|
| **Mock Dependencies** | `mockRepo.findById.mockResolvedValue(user)` | Call real database |
| **Use Fixtures** | `agentConfigs.queenCoordinator` | Inline object literals |
| **Test Behavior** | `expect(mockNotifier.notify).toHaveBeenCalled()` | `expect(service._queue.length).toBe(1)` |
| **Isolate Tests** | `vi.clearAllMocks()` in `beforeEach` | Share state between tests |
| **Verify Interactions** | `expect(save).toHaveBeenCalledBefore(notify)` | Assert implementation details |

### Common Issues

**MCP server won't start**
```bash
# Check if port is in use
lsof -i :3000
# Kill existing process
kill -9 <PID>
# Restart MCP server
npx ruflo@v3alpha mcp start
```

**Agent spawn failures**
```bash
# Check available memory
free -m
# Reduce max agents if memory constrained
export CLAUDE_FLOW_MAX_AGENTS=5
```

**Pattern search returning no results**
```bash
# Verify patterns are stored
npx ruflo@v3alpha hooks metrics
# Re-run pretraining if empty
npx ruflo@v3alpha hooks pretrain
```

**Windows path issues**
```powershell
# Use forward slashes or escape backslashes
$env:CLAUDE_FLOW_MEMORY_PATH = "./data"
# Or use absolute path
$env:CLAUDE_FLOW_MEMORY_PATH = "C:/Users/name/ruflo/data"
```

**Permission denied errors**
```bash
# Fix npm permissions (Linux/macOS)
sudo chown -R $(whoami) ~/.npm
# Or use nvm to manage Node.js
```

**High memory usage**
```bash
# Enable garbage collection
node --expose-gc node_modules/.bin/ruflo
# Reduce HNSW parameters for lower memory
export CLAUDE_FLOW_HNSW_M=8
export CLAUDE_FLOW_HNSW_EF=100
```

<summary>🔄 <strong>Migration Guide (V2 → V3)</strong></summary>

### Why Migrate to V3?

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    V2 → V3 IMPROVEMENTS                     │
├───────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Memory Search         │ 150x - 12,500x faster (HNSW)        │
│ Pattern Matching      │ Self-learning (ReasoningBank)       │
│ Security              │ CVE remediation + strict validation │
│ Modular Architecture  │ 18 @claude-flow/* packages          │
│ Agent Coordination    │ 60+ specialized agents              │
│ Token Efficiency      │ 32% reduction with optimization     │
└───────────────────────┴─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Breaking Changes

| Change | V2 | V3 | Impact |
|--------|----|----|--------|
| **Package Structure** | `ruflo` | `@claude-flow/*` (scoped) | Update imports |
| **Memory Backend** | JSON files | AgentDB + HNSW | Faster search |
| **Hooks System** | Basic patterns | ReasoningBank + SONA | Self-learning |
| **Security** | Manual validation | Automatic strict mode | More secure |
| **CLI Commands** | Flat structure | Nested subcommands | New syntax |
| **Config Format** | `.ruflo/config.json` | `claude-flow.config.json` | Update path |

### Step-by-Step Migration

```bash
# STEP 1: Backup existing data (CRITICAL)
cp -r ./data ./data-backup-v2
cp -r ./.ruflo ./.ruflo-backup-v2

# STEP 2: Check migration status
npx ruflo@v3alpha migrate status

# STEP 3: Run migration with dry-run first
npx ruflo@v3alpha migrate run --dry-run

# STEP 4: Execute migration
npx ruflo@v3alpha migrate run --from v2

# STEP 5: Verify migration
npx ruflo@v3alpha migrate verify

# STEP 6: Initialize V3 learning
npx ruflo@v3alpha hooks pretrain
npx ruflo@v3alpha doctor --fix
```

### Command Changes Reference

| V2 Command | V3 Command | Notes |
|------------|------------|-------|
| `ruflo start` | `ruflo mcp start` | MCP is explicit |
| `ruflo init` | `ruflo init --wizard` | Interactive mode |
| `ruflo spawn <type>` | `ruflo agent spawn -t <type>` | Nested under `agent` |
| `ruflo swarm create` | `ruflo swarm init --topology mesh` | Explicit topology |
| `--pattern-store path` | `--memory-backend agentdb` | Backend selection |
| `hooks record` | `hooks post-edit --success true` | Explicit success flag |
| `memory get <key>` | `memory retrieve --key <key>` | Explicit flag |
| `memory set <key> <value>` | `memory store --key <key> --value <value>` | Explicit flags |
| `neural learn` | `hooks intelligence --mode learn` | Under hooks |
| `config set key value` | `config set --key key --value value` | Explicit flags |

### Configuration Migration

**V2 Config (`.ruflo/config.json`)**:
```json
{
  "mode": "basic",
  "patternStore": "./patterns",
  "maxAgents": 10
}
```

**V3 Config (`claude-flow.config.json`)**:
```json
{
  "version": "3.0.0",
  "memory": {
    "type": "hybrid",
    "path": "./data",
    "hnsw": { "m": 16, "ef": 200 }
  },
  "swarm": {
    "topology": "hierarchical",
    "maxAgents": 15,
    "strategy": "specialized"
  },
  "security": { "mode": "strict" },
  "neural": { "enabled": true, "sona": true }
}
```

### Import Changes

```typescript
// V2 (deprecated)
import { ClaudeFlow, Agent, Memory } from 'ruflo';

// V3 (new)
import { ClaudeFlowClient } from '@claude-flow/cli';
import { AgentDB } from '@claude-flow/memory';
import { ThreatDetector } from '@claude-flow/security';
import { HNSWIndex } from '@claude-flow/embeddings';
```

### Rollback Procedure

If migration fails, you can rollback:

```bash
# Check rollback options
npx ruflo@v3alpha migrate rollback --list

# Rollback to V2
npx ruflo@v3alpha migrate rollback --to v2

# Restore backup manually if needed
rm -rf ./data
cp -r ./data-backup-v2 ./data
```

### Post-Migration Checklist

- [ ] Verify all agents spawn correctly: `npx ruflo@v3alpha agent list`
- [ ] Check memory search works: `npx ruflo@v3alpha memory search -q "test"`
- [ ] Confirm MCP server starts: `npx ruflo@v3alpha mcp start`
- [ ] Run doctor diagnostics: `npx ruflo@v3alpha doctor`
- [ ] Test a simple swarm: `npx ruflo@v3alpha swarm init --topology mesh`
- [ ] Bootstrap learning: `npx ruflo@v3alpha hooks pretrain`

### Common Migration Issues

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` | Old package references | Update imports to `@claude-flow/*` |
| `Config not found` | Path change | Rename to `claude-flow.config.json` |
| `Memory backend error` | Schema change | Run `migrate run` to convert |
| `Hooks not working` | New hook names | Use new hook commands |
| `Agent spawn fails` | Type name changes | Check `agent list` for new types |
